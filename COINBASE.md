We've teamed up with Coinbase to bring you a quick, easy way to purchase small amounts of Ether using a Debit card, without needing to sign up for an account.


### How does it work?

When you click on "Buy" a new web page will appear to begin the simple purchase flow.

After verifying your email address, and a phone number, simply enter your debit card number and expiry date, and $5 worth of ETH will instantly be sent to your MetaMask address. 

### How much Ether can I buy?

You can purchase up to $5 of ETH per day, up to a liftime total of $50. Beyond that limit, you'll be asked to create a Coinbase account to continue purchasing ETH via the MetaMask integration.

### How long does it take?

It takes about two minutes to run through the purchase process. Once the purchase is complete, Coinbase will send your ETH instantly, but it may take up to a minute to appear in MetaMask.

### Why do I need to provide an email address and phone number?

This helps Coinbase prevent fraud. 

### Is available outside the US?

No, not yet. Sorry. 

### Are there other payment options available?

Sorry, at the moment debit cards are the only accepted payment method.
