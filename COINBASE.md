We've teamed up with Coinbase to bring you a quick, easy way to purchase small amounts of Ether using a Debit card, without needing to sign up for an account.


### How does it work?

When you click "Buy", a **buy Ether** web page appears.

After providing your email address and phone number, enter your debit card number and its expiry date. The app instantly adds $5-worth of ETH to your MetaMask address.

### How much Ether can I buy?

You can purchase up to $5 of ETH per day, with a lifetime total of $50. Beyond that limit, you'll be asked to sign into Coinbase and complete further verifications to continue purchasing ETH via the MetaMask integration.

### How long does it take?

A buying the ETH takes about two minutes. Coinbase sends the ETH instantly, but it can take up to a minute to appear in your MetaMask account balance.

### Why do I need to provide an email address and phone number?

This information helps Coinbase prevent fraud.

### Is this feature available outside the US?

No, not yet. Sorry.

### Are there other payment options available?

Sorry, at the moment debit cards are the only accepted payment method.
